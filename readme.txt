To build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic, we'll follow these steps:

Data Preparation

Load the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Feature engineering (if necessary).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand the data through visualization.
Analyze relationships between features and survival.
Model Building

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest).
Evaluate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tune the model (if necessary).
